# Testausserveri.fi

This repository holds the website of Testausserveri ry and DNS configurations of testausserveri.fi domain. 

Keep in mind that we are planning a redesign of our website during autumn-winter 2021, therefore we don't recommend you making major changes just yet.

DNS configurations are stored in the [`dns/dnsconfig.js`](https://github.com/Testausserveri/testausserveri.fi/blob/main/dns/dnsconfig.js) file and are directly synchronized to Cloudflare. For more advanced configurations please seek information from [DNSControl documentation](https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/js). Channel #yleinen on our Discord server is also more than happy to help you! 😊

## Contributing

- open an issue to discuss what you would like to change, or
- discuss about the changes on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/testaus).

Please also take some time to give your pull request a descriptive title and a detailed description.
